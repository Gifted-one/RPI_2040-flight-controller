# RPI_2040-flight-controller
This project is a custom-built quadcopter flight controller developed on the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) using an MPU6050 IMU and hardware PWM at 400Hz for ESC control. The aim of this project is to gain a deep, low-level understanding of multirotor stabilisation, control theory, and embedded flight software
